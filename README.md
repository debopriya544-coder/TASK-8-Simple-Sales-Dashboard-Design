# TASK-8-Simple-Sales-Dashboard-Design
I have downloaded the Superstore sales data from kaggle.
After downloading the data I imported the data into Tableau. Here, I made a dashboard named Superstore performance traker. In the dashboard I made a bar chart using regional sales and a line chart based on order date and sales and a donut chart by using category wise sales.
I also made a slicer named year wise regional sales. Here, we can filter the region wise sales based on year.
And I also create a text file for insights from Superstore sales dataset.
